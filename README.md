## ABB1410
* This folder contains the video simulation ABB1410 on ABB RobotStudio, in which I have used the manipulator to trace out the 2 initial letters of my name.

## MatlabCodes

 * This folder contains the forward kinematics and dynamic models I developed for manipulators having up to 4 degrees of freedom.


     * The file "4DOF-planar kinematics" contains the forward kinematics of a 4 DoF "TRRR planar" manipulator:

     * The File "2DOF Dynamics: Lagrenge Euler" contains the dynamic model of a 2 DoF 'VR' Manipulator using Lagrange Euler method
         
     * The File "2DOF Dynamics: Newton Euler" contains the dynamic model of a 2 DoF 'VR' Manipulator using Newton Euler method

## Paper
* This folder contains the term paper I wronte on the topic "POTENTIAL WAYS OF REDUCING COST OF THE QUADRUPED 'SPOT' DEVELOPED BY BOSTON DYNAMICS" that I wrote under the supervision of prof. Bijay Kumar Rout, BITS Pilani for my cousre on manipulator robotics.
