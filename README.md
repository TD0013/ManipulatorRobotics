# ManipulatorRobotics
This repository contains the work that I have done in the field of manipulator robotics.
This includes:
 a. The term paper that I wrote on the topic "POTENTIAL WAYS OF REDUCING COST OF THE QUADRUPED 'SPOT' DEVELOPED BY BOSTON DYNAMICS"
 b. A video simulation ABB1410 on ABB RobotStudio, in which I have used the manipulator to trace out the 2 initial letters of my name.
