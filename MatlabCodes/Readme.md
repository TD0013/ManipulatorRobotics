This folder contains the forward kinematics and dynamic models I developed for manipulators having up to 4 degrees of freedom.


The file "4DOF-planar kinematics" contains the forward kinematics of a 4- DOF arm with a 3R planar arm mounted on a rail to have linear motion.
Refer to "4-DOF Robot.png" for [model](https://github.com/TD0013/ManipulatorRobotics/blob/main/MatlabCodes/4-DOF%20Robot.png)

The File "2DOF Dynamics: Lagrenge Euler" contains the dynamic model of a 2 DoF 'VR' Manipulator using Lagrange Euler method
The File "2DOF Dynamics: Newton Euler" contains the dynamic model of a 2 DoF 'VR' Manipulator using Newton Euler method
